  Description: The Ardyn are a feared and mistrusted race. Their rapid aging combined
    with the inherent ability to siphon the life-force from other entities has produced
    a culture intent on the dominance and subjugation of others. Their profound understanding
    of void magic and the construction of beautiful works of art is often overshadowed
    by their brutal nature.
  DiscoveryHint: Is something evil if its actions are in its nature? Many Ancient
    scholars wrestled with this idea when it came to the Ardyn.
