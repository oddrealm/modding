  Message: '{*}A low rumble vibrates the air. Slowly, it builds, with the inevitability
    of a stone tumbling down a mountain. The earth begins to undulate with its rhythm.
    Many horrors reside within the depths of Odd, but only the fearsome Wyrm is known
    to summon the power of an earthquake. The noise is blinding, and standing is
    only achieved by the strongest trees as the creature rends the earth below. Unseen,
    the Wyrm passes and, with each breath, the chaos gradually eases. A tremendous
    scar traces the earth, marking the creature''s path.{*/}'
